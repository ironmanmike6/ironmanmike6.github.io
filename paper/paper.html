<h1>Server Scale</h1>
<p>Amazon's server stack is vast and complex. It is not an easy task to simply explain what they use for particular tasks, because they
simple answer is, they use a multitude of different types of servers for each task. Luckily, the servers that Amazon uses to host their website
are the very same ones that they make available to other companies such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Netflix and Autodesk </a> on their Amazon
Web Services program.</p>
    <p>
        Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a massive assortment of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/products/">compute, storage, database, analytics, application and deployment services.</a>
        Essentially, anything you might need a server or servers for, Amazon is able to provide. These services also have to ability to scale massively with the help of features
        such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/details/">Elastic Load Balancing</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2)</a>.
        These features combined allow anyone, including Amazon themselves to scale up or down the number of servers dedicated to any one task. To show just how ridiculous these
        servers can scale, Netflix uses <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/netflix-streaming-eats-up-35-of-downstream-internet-bandwidth-usage-study-1201360914/">35% of the bandwidth</a>
        in North America during peak hours. Netflix is hosted entirely on Amazon's servers using Amazon Web Services.

    <h1>
        The Actual Tech
    </h1>
    <h2>OS Choices</h2>
    <p>
        Amazon runs virtually everything on Linux machines. Primarily they run either <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/partners/redhat/">RHEL5</a> or a specific <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/">Amazon Linux</a> distribution.
    </p>
    <h2>Platforms</h2>
    <p>
        Amazon uses a variety of languages, but primarily uses <a href="http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture"> C++, Perl, Mason, Java, Jboss and Servlets. </a> The website
        makes <a href="http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture">hundreds of calls</a> to various services on the backend to display a single web page. Most third party technologies
        don't scale to the massive size that Amazon expects and thus <a href="http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture">many features are created</a>, a lot of which
        are available to the public through AWS.
    </p>
    <h2>
       Computational Servers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Amazon has a series of computationally focused servers which has the c4.large which as 2 virtual CPUs, and 3.75 GiB of memory. There a series of larger and larger
        computational servers all the way up to the C4.8xlarge which has 36 virtual CPUs and 60 GiB of memory. The storage on these servers is done through <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Elastic Block Storage</a>
        which stores everything on a remote server and keeps data safe. These servers feature a high frequency Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) processor.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Development Servers
    </h2>
    <p>
        The smallest server Amazon uses is the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">t2.micro</a> which has only a single CPU, and 1 GiB of memory. They also
        offer t2.small and t2.medium which have 1 CPU with 2 GiB of memory and 2 CPUs with 4 GiB of memory respectively. These run on Intel Xeon Processors from 2.5GHz to 3.3GHz with Turbo.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Database Servers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Amazon has many high storage servers such as the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">i2.xlarge</a> which features 4 virtual CPUs, 30.5 GiB of memory and 1x800 GB SSD. The largest
        storage optimized server is the i2.8xlarge which as 32 virtual CPUs, 244 GiB of memory and 8x800 GB SDD. It runs on an Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2 (Ivy Bridge) processor and has
        high random I/O performance.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Data Warehouse
    </h2>
    <p>
        Amazon has one server specifically optimized for high reads and writes performance with very high storage. It is the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">hs1.8xlarge</a>
        and features 16 virtual CPUs, 117 GiB of memory and 24x2000 GB of storage. It is capable of 2.6 GB per second read and write performance with 2 MiB block size.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Security
    </h2>
    <p>
        Amazon employs a variety of methods of security, with the most important one being on how they handle users personal information such as credit cards and addresses. Amazon
        uses the <a href="http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon1.htm">Netscape Secure Commerce Server</a> using the SSL protocol. Credit cards are stored in a database
        not accessible from the internet. Amazon allows users to encrypt every piece of information that they enter about themselves.
